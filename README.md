-- BASIC CHEMISTRY CALCULATOR - by Lee Gallagher --

A simple program that I am creating to allow a user to: 

1. Search elements of the periodic table, either by name or by atomic number, by means of a database that the program retrieves data about the elements from.

2. Use that data to calculate the molecular weight of simple molecules by typing in their chemical formula.

As the program is developed, more features will be added, such as a dictionary of simple molecules, atomic group data and search-up, as well as other more advanced features.
